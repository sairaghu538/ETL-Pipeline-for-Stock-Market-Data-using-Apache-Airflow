Several free and paid stock market APIs are available. Here are a few options:

Polygon.io (Free with API Key) - https://polygon.io/

Alpha Vantage (Free with API Key) - https://www.alphavantage.co/

Yahoo Finance (yfinance) (Free, No API Key) - https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/

For this project, we'll use Polygon.io because it provides structured historical and real-time stock data.
